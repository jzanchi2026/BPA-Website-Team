FOR IMAGE USAGE:
Single images (such as those on Google® Images) may be used in their entirety without
seeking permission, but you will need to seek permission to use more than five images by
a single artist or photographer. Regardless, you must always credit your source, i.e., the
website from which the image was taken. This likely does not mean Google® (if you ran
a Google Image search), but rather the website where the picture was posted.
• From a collection, not more than 15 images or 10 percent (whichever is less) may be used
without seeking permission (though you must credit your source).
• If you are using an image you found on Pinterest® or Instagram®, try to determine who is
the owner of the image and, if necessary according to the rules set forth above, seek that
person’s permission to use it. Do not assume whoever posted the image is the owner.
(Although Pinterest’s Terms of Service do allow you to share/use photos that are posted
by others, that right is limited to use on Pinterest.)
• If you are using an image you found on Twitter® or Facebook®, determine if the person
who posted it is the owner of the image. If so, you may use it without seeking permission.
This is because Twitter® and Facebook®’s Terms of Service, unlike Pinterest®’s and
Instagram®’s, allow you to share photos that are posted by others. If the person who
posted it does not own the image, however, you should determine who owns the rights to
the image and seek permission if necessary under the rules described above.
• Again, regardless of whether permission to use an image is necessary, always cite your
source.

FOR VIDEO USAGE:
The material must be legitimately acquired (a legal copy, not illegally downloaded,
bootleg, or home recording).
• You may use 10% or three minutes (whichever is less) of “motion media” without seeking
permission (though, as always, cite your source).
• Videos from websites ending in .gov are public domain and therefore may be used without
seeking permission (though cite your source).
• If you are creating your own video from clips of other copyrighted videos, the video must
be “transformative,” i.e., a new use of the original video such as a commentary on or
criticism of it, as opposed to simply a reuse of the original video. Use only as much of
each copyrighted video as necessary.
• If the video is from YouTube®, Facebook®, Periscope®, or another site where users
generate content, be especially careful to determine if it was posted by the creator. If so,
you can use up to 10% or three minutes of it (whichever is less) without seeking
permission, but be sure to cite your source. If it is a re-posting by a third party, determine
whether the original is available from another source. Do not include a video you have
reason to believe infringes a copyright in your presentation (a “bootleg” video recording,
for example).
